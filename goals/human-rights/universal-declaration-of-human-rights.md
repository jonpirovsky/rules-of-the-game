## Preamble

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,

Whereas it is essential, if humanity is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the will of the people,

Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between peoples and individuals,

Whereas all the members affirm their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of all individuals and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,

Whereas all the Members pledge themselves to achieve, in co-operation, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,

We the people

Proclaim this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all individuals and institutions, to the end that, keeping this Declaration in mind, shall strive to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance.s
